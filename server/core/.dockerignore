# dockerignore file, specifies what files should not be sent as build context to the docker daemon.
# Refer to https://stackoverflow.com/a/45118985 for an explaination on build process and what is included in build context
# Refer to Last paragraph of https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file for an explaination about how the build context is selected in this .dockerignore file
# Note: this optimizations are not really needed when using buildkit. Here's why https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#buildkit

# This dockerignore file uses the whitelist layout format as explained above.
# .Dockerfile and this .dockerignore will also be ignored, but will still be automatically sent to docker daemon by default
# Certain things that must be ignored:
#       - .git
#       - secrets/.env (visible via docker inspect if build context is cached)

# Ignore everything first to use dockerignore as a whitelist instead of a blacklist

# Allow package json files to be copied over for installing dependencies
!package*.json

# Allow webpack build output files in build/ as the only source files in the build context
# Not specifying a specific build file as the Dockerfile is designed to build images for all worker nodes.
!build/
